Using Git effectively in team development is crucial for project success. Let's explore popular Git branching strategies and collaboration workflows.

## Git Flow Strategy

Git Flow is one of the most widely used branching strategies.

### Branch Structure

- **main**: Released stable code
- **develop**: Integration branch for development
- **feature**: New feature development
- **release**: Release preparation
- **hotfix**: Emergency bug fixes

```bash
# Initialize Git Flow
git flow init

# Start a new feature
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Finish a feature
git flow feature finish user-authentication

# Start a release
git flow release start v1.2.0

# Finish a release
git flow release finish v1.2.0

# Start a hotfix
git flow hotfix start critical-bug

# Finish a hotfix
git flow hotfix finish critical-bug
```

### Workflow Example

```bash
# Developer A starts working on a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git flow feature start shopping-cart

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add shopping cart functionality"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/shopping-cart

# Finish feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish shopping-cart

# Prepare for release
git flow release start v2.1.0

# Make final adjustments
git commit -m "Update version number"

# Finish release (merges to main and develop)
git flow release finish v2.1.0
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push --tags
```

## GitHub Flow Strategy

A simpler strategy ideal for continuous deployment.

### Workflow

1. Create branch from main
2. Add commits
3. Open Pull Request
4. Discuss and review
5. Deploy and test
6. Merge to main

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/user-profile
git push -u origin feature/user-profile

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page"
git push origin feature/user-profile

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# After review and approval, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/user-profile
```

## GitLab Flow Strategy

Combines benefits of Git Flow and GitHub Flow with environment branches.

### Branch Structure

- **main**: Production code
- **pre-production**: Staging environment
- **feature branches**: Feature development

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration main

# Development work
git add .
git commit -m "Implement payment gateway"
git push origin feature/payment-integration

# Merge to pre-production for testing
git checkout pre-production
git merge feature/payment-integration
git push origin pre-production

# After testing, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge pre-production
git push origin main
```

## Feature Branch Workflow

Simple workflow focusing on feature isolation.

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/search-functionality

# Work on feature
echo "Search component" > search.js
git add search.js
git commit -m "Add search functionality"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/search-functionality

# After review, merge via Pull Request
# Clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/search-functionality
git push origin --delete feature/search-functionality
```

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up commit history before merging:

```bash
# Interactive rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Rebase options:
# pick = use commit
# reword = edit commit message
# edit = edit commit
# squash = combine with previous commit
# drop = remove commit

# Example rebase file:
pick abc123 Add login feature
squash def456 Fix login bug
reword ghi789 Add tests
```

### Cherry Pick

Apply specific commits to another branch:

```bash
# Apply commit to current branch
git cherry-pick abc123

# Apply multiple commits
git cherry-pick abc123 def456

# Apply commit without committing
git cherry-pick --no-commit abc123
```

### Stashing

Temporarily save changes:

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Stash with message
git stash push -m "Work in progress on feature X"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply latest stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When merge conflicts occur
git status

# Edit conflicted files
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Their changes
# >>>>>>> branch-name

# After resolving conflicts
git add conflicted-file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Using Merge Tools

```bash
# Configure merge tool
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

# Use merge tool for conflicts
git mergetool

# Popular merge tools:
# - VS Code: code --wait
# - Sublime: subl --wait
# - Atom: atom --wait
```

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### Commit Message Conventions

```bash
# Conventional Commits format
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve null pointer exception"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

# Types:
# feat: new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation
# style: formatting
# refactor: code restructuring
# test: adding tests
# chore: maintenance
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

```markdown
## Pull Request Template

### Description
Brief description of changes

### Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

### Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Comments added for complex logic

```

### Code Review Process

```bash
# Reviewer checks out PR branch
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/new-feature

# Run tests
npm test

# Review changes
git diff main...feature/new-feature

# Add review comments via GitHub/GitLab
# Request changes or approve
```

## Automation and CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

### Husky Pre-commit Hooks

```json
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write",
      "git add"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Branch Protection Rules

Protect important branches with rules:

```bash
# GitHub CLI example
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["ci/tests"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

```bash
# Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (patch: bug fix)
# 1.0.1 → 1.1.0 (minor: new feature)
# 1.1.0 → 2.0.0 (major: breaking change)

# Using npm version
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
npm version minor  # 1.0.1 → 1.1.0
npm version major  # 1.1.0 → 2.0.0
```

### Automated Releases

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Create Release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        draft: false
        prerelease: false
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo commit that was already pushed
git revert HEAD
```

### Clean Working Directory

```bash
# Remove untracked files
git clean -fd

# Remove ignored files
git clean -fX

# Remove all untracked and ignored files
git clean -fx
```

### Recover Lost Commits

```bash
# Show reflog
git reflog

# Recover lost commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovered-branch
```

## Choosing the Right Strategy

### Git Flow
- **Best for**: Traditional release cycles
- **Team size**: Medium to large
- **Release frequency**: Scheduled releases

### GitHub Flow
- **Best for**: Continuous deployment
- **Team size**: Small to medium
- **Release frequency**: Frequent deployments

### GitLab Flow
- **Best for**: Multiple environments
- **Team size**: Any size
- **Release frequency**: Regular releases with staging

## Conclusion

Choose a branching strategy that fits your team size, release cycle, and deployment process. Start simple and evolve your workflow as the team grows. Consistency and clear guidelines are more important than the perfect strategy.
